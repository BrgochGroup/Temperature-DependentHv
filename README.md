# Predicting temperature-dependent Vickers hardness

## Model overview
This model demonstrated an efficient and accurate machine-learning method to directly predict a material's experimentally measured temperature-dependent Vickers hardness.

## Temperature and load dependence
This model is able to take two external factors into consideration: temperature (K) and applied load (N), making predictions of the same structure at different temperature/load.
