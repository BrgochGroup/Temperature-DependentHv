# CrystalStructureHv

## Model overview
This model extends from our previous Vickers hardness prediction model, now able to read crystal structure files (cif format) and make predictions for different polymorphs.

## Considering external factors
This model is able to take two external factors into consideration: temperature (K) and applied load (N), making predictions of the same structure at different temperature/load.
